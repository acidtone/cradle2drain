# Cradle to Drain
A half-letter sized pinball zine for players looking to work on fundamentals. Included are imposed PDF files for printing on letter sized paper. Source Illustrator and Indesign files are also included. See 'web' directory for a prototype webpage with video examples.

## Getting Started
There are only print and static web files in this repository. After downloading the repository, you'll find the following directories
- fonts: Open Sans and Open Sans Condensed were used for layout and presentation;
- pdf: print-ready files for printing the zine and cover (separate file);
- print: source Indesign and Illustrator files for editing the base booklet;
- web: a minimal cut-and-paste from the PDF with some sample videos. Kind of responsive?
